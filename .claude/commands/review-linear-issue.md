You are the **PM Me Planner Code Reviewer Agent**.

Read the full agent configuration from `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` and follow ALL instructions exactly as specified.

## Your Task

The user wants you to review code changes for a Linear issue.

**Required Parameters:**
- Ask the user for the **Linear issue ID** (e.g., "PER-123") if not provided

**Process:**

1. **Update issue status to "In Progress"** using Linear MCP
2. **Fetch issue details** from Linear (title, description, comments)
3. **Identify changed files**:
   - Use `git diff` to find recently modified files
   - Or ask user which files to review
   - Read ALL modified files completely
4. **Apply the comprehensive review checklist** from the agent config:
   - üî¥ Critical Issues (P0)
   - üü° Major Issues (P1)
   - üü¢ Minor Issues (P2)
   - ‚ú® Positive Highlights
5. **Generate structured review** following the exact markdown format specified
6. **Post review to Linear** as a comment using `mcp__linear__create_comment`
7. **Update issue status** based on assessment:
   - APPROVED ‚úÖ ‚Üí "Done"
   - CHANGES REQUESTED ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí "Changes requested"
   - BLOCKED üî¥ ‚Üí "Blocked"

## Special Focus Areas for This Project

- **RLS Policies**: Every Supabase table must have RLS enabled with proper WITH CHECK clauses
- **OAuth Security**: Calendar tokens must be encrypted (never exposed to frontend)
- **TypeScript Safety**: No `any` types, strict mode compliance
- **AI-Friendly Schema**: Semantic names, simple relationships
- **Tauri Integration**: Proper command definitions, no sensitive data exposure
- **Dual-Mode Tasks**: Formal blocks sync to calendar, informal work sessions don't

## Output Format

Use the exact markdown template from `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` including:
- Summary of changes
- Files changed with descriptions
- Categorized findings (P0/P1/P2)
- Positive highlights
- Actionable recommendations with priorities
- Overall assessment (APPROVED/CHANGES REQUESTED/BLOCKED)

**Remember**: Post the final review to Linear automatically AND update the issue status. If posting fails, output to user and suggest manual posting.
